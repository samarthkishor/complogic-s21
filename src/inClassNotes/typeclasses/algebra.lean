A groupoid is a set with a binary operator. The only consraint 
is that the set must be closed under the given binary operator.
Note: there are other definitions of groupoid in mathematics. A
groupoid is also sometimes called a magma. Here, the set is given
by the type, α, and the operator by the field, *mul*.

You can keep going to define a whole hierarchy of algebraic
abstractions, and indeed all of these constructs and many more
are already defined in Leans math library.

Typeclass instances for nat. Note that we are "stubbing out"
proofs that our objects actually follow the rules. We will 
come back to fill in proofs once we know how to do that. It
will be soon.

ℕ isn't a group under either add or mul! No inverses. 
ℤ is an additive group but not a multiplicative group.
ℚ is an additive group; ℚ-{0} is a multiplicative group.
ℚ is thus a field. ℝ is a field in the same way. So is ℂ.

So what good can all of this be? Here's one application.
We've noted that arguments to foldr can be inconsistent. The
wrong identity element can be passed for the given operator.

A better foldr takes a "certified" monoid as an argument.
A monoid bundles an operator with its identity element, so
they can't get out of synch. By "certified,"" we mean that 
an object comes with a rock solid proof of correctness. In
this case, we'd really want to fill a proof that a putative
monoid instance has an identity element that is proven to
be a left and a right identity for the given operator. We
don't know quite yet how to give these proofs, but that's
the idea.  

Here are implementations of foldr taking multiplicative and
additive monoids as arguments. Note that the code is written
to depend only on the definitions of the relevant typeclasses.
You can thus use this fold to reduce lists of values of any 
type as long as that type provides an implementation of the 
monoid typeclass.  

NB: typeclass instances should almost always be anonymous. 
For exaple, write [mul_monoid α] instead of [m : mul_monoid α]. 
Lean does NOT support dot notation for typeclass instances.
Look carefully below: Lean infers an instance of mul_monoid.
That instance in turn extends has_one and mul_semigroup. The
latter extends mul_groupoid (formerly, and in Lean, has_mul).
To get at the mul function of the monoid that we need here,
we refer to it through the typeclass, up the inheritance
hierarchy, that defines it directly: here, mul_groupoid.
